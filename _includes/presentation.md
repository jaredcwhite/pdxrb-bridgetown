# Allow Me To Introduce Myself

.avatar[![Jared White](https://jaredwhite.com/assets/jared-white-2018-II.jpg)]

Iâ€™m Jared White, the Founder and Lead Rubyist at [Whitefusion](https://whitefusion.io),  
a boutique web studio based in Portland, OR.

Iâ€™ve been at this Ruby on Rails game since v2 (circa 2008).

And as a designer/developer in general, since 1997!!! ðŸ˜±

# Now Hereâ€™s An Interesting Thing

It dawned on me, as I was putting this presentation together, that I owe my livelihood as a developer to essentially three companies:

--

1. **Basecamp**
1. **Shopify**
1. **GitHub**

--

But itâ€™s not just Rails Iâ€™m talking aboutâ€¦

## On December 13, 2005â€¦

DHH released the first official 1.0 version of **Ruby on Rails**.

--

## In 2006â€¦

Tobi LÃ¼tke released **Liquid**, a Ruby-based template engine used by his new startup **Shopify**. (Much more on Shopify shortlyâ€¦)

--

## In 2008â€¦

Tom Preston-Warner, founder of **GitHub**, was fed up with WordPress and coded up a little Git-friendly static site generator called **Jekyll**. Tom's template engine of choice? You guessed it: **Liquid**.

# Fast-Forward to Today

On any given day of a typical week, I'm just as likely to be working on a Jekyll-based website as I am a Rails-based application. But in either case, the core technologies were spearheaded by those three companies I just mentioned. And you know what else is cool?

# Guess Which Companies Are the <em>Top Contributors</em> to Rails for v6 and Beyond?

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# Basecamp

--

# Shopify

# GitHub

## _And all three are running off of <br/>**rails master**!!!_ ðŸ¤¯

---

# Now Hereâ€™s Something Even Cooler?!

We all know that **Amazon** is the largest e-commerce platform in **America**.  
Theyâ€™re huge. Maybe even yuge!

But do you know who the _second largest_ is?

--

# Shopify!

\* <small>well, itâ€™s actually eBay, but Shopify is on track to surpass them by the end of the year.</small>

## **Q:** Is Rails dying?

## **A:** Yes, you should switch to Node.js and AngularJS (v1).

# Thankfully, Rails did not, <br/>in fact, die!

We got a solid 5.0 release, then 5.1 with Webpacker (truly a major leap forward!), then more recently 5.2.

Meanwhile, GitHub went through a **massive** overhaul of its Rails codebase (at the leading of the very talented Eileen M. Uchitelle) to shift from using a crazy fork of Rails 2.x to using modern, "stock" Rails. This is what allowed GitHub to go even farther and [start running off of master](https://github.blog/2019-09-09-running-github-on-rails-6-0/) and contributing heavily to Rails for version 6 (and they show no signs of stopping!)

[Shopify is also running off of master](https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/living-on-the-edge-of-rails) and has also contributed heavily to Rails 6.

# Bottom line: Rails is arguably in the best shape ever!

## And there was much rejoicing o'er the land!

# OK, letâ€™s dive into Rails 6.

# The Best Feature of Rails 6

Thanks to the new **Action Mailbox** framework, it is now fully compliant with **Zawinskiâ€™s Law**!
